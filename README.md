# CGPKT
Toward Personalized Knowledge Tracing Model Integrating Concepts Importance and Group Features
CGPKT is a personalised knowledge tracking model that incorporates the importance of knowledge concepts and group features. He achieved good performance results on the evaluation metrics we selected.
The document structure is distributed in the following way:
main.py and example.py are the implementation code of the main model, which combines both knowledge concept importance and group features.
The ablation_study.py file is the validation results of the ablation experiment.
analyze_correct_rate.py is the visual implementation of the statistics and distribution of the correct rate for the dataset.
The knowledge_cluster.py file is the visualisation of the clustering effect of the knowledge points after pre-training.
plot_model_comparsion.py is the implementation of histograms and line charts for the model's ACC, AUC, and RMSE results.
data.py is the function for raw data processing.
Finally student_log_i is the data involved in the dataset, as well as some other pictures of the results.
